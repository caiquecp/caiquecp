### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ (it's default by I like it)

I'm Caique, 28yo. I have been working as a software engineer for the past 8 years.

Currently working at Luizalabs (one of the biggest retail companies in Brazil) and also at ToolboxDev (my side project company).

Most of my career I have worked as full-stack engineer, although I've been focusing way more on backend.

#### ToolboxDev

I'm building apps to support tabletop RPG / boardgame players. Take a look at [ToolboxDev](https://www.toolboxdev.site/) to check my apps.

#### Technologies and skills

- Python, JavaScript, FastAPI, React
- Web development, software architecture
- Application containerization, Kubernetes, Cloud, GCP
- Code review, process and system documentation
- Back-end, full-stack
